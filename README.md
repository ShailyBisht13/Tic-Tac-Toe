Here's a description of a Tic Tac Toe game in C++ that allows both a player and the computer to play against each other. The game involves a 3x3 grid where players take turns to mark their symbol ("X" or "O") on the grid. The game checks for a winner after each move. If there's no winner yet, the game continues until either a player wins or the grid is full (resulting in a draw).
Features:
1. Two modes of play: Player vs. Player (PvP) and Player vs. 
    Computer (PvC).
2. Game board: A 3x3 grid is displayed, and players can choose 
    where to place their symbol.
3. Computer: A single player competes against the computer. 
    The computer will make moves based on an algorithm.
4. Turn-based gameplay: Players alternate placing their marks, 
    starting with "X".
5. Win condition: The game checks for a winner (three of the 
    same marks in a row, column, or diagonal).
6. Draw condition: The game ends in a draw if the board is full 
    and there is no winner.
